# Weather_Journal_App

# Project Description: 
Weather Application App that fetches data from an API called "Open Weather Map API". First the user is asked to enter the country's zip code then the api takes the entered zip code, searches for the city's name using the zip code, and then retrieves this city's weather condition. Finally, the retrieved info is shown for the user in a small box.
